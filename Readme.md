The is a proof-of-concept for creating an invalid garmin firmware file (gcd)
that can cause an crash. This is designed and tested on the device `edge130apac`
but it may work on similar devices.

In regular updates, if the update file is present on the flash, the device
prompts the user with the options `Yes` and `No` to update.

But the files generated by this project will cause a buffer overflow, that could
result in arbitrary code execution. And this happen before the user is prompted,
so as long the file is uploaded, the buffer overflow can be triggered.
